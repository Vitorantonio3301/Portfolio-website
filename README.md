## 1. Project description;
Hello, that's a project that i worked for training purposes. I tried to create a portfolio-website using only HTML5 and CSS using frameworks like Bootstrap with Node.JS.
So i tried to make some simples stuff like putting a photo of me, a simple text, two pages one beeing the "home" page and other the "about me' page. Really simple stuff.
I was really tryin to use all the most used concepts and mechanics in both languages, like divs, classes, separations and other things on HTML, but also hover, varients
flex display, positions, resposivity and more on CSS. Please notice that this project was made with the help of a course that i was doing wich was from where i took the design,
but all the code and thing alike was writen by me wich i took little to nothing from the course. For those who speak portuguese and want also acess to the course, you can search
for Alura". I will also give them the credits mmore down on this document, but i decided to also mention here on the start.

üöß Building project üöß
I still trying to figure out things like resposivity for smaller devices like smartphones wich i know are of the mos importants ways the people acess internet nowadays.
My struggle with flex display continues, but  i can say that i'am way more confident and can play more then when i staterd with flex display. Course, i still trying master it.

## 3. Funcionalities;
Some of the funcionalities that you can expect to find in this website are:
- Language mechanic usage;
- Language conceps usage;
- Muliple pages;
- Respostivity;
- Flex display;
- Organization;
- Hover;

## 4. Acquired knowledge;</h2>
For the most part i was focusing on the concept of flex display and the stuff surrounding it. So i learned a lot about it. 
Since i also writen all the code from the things that i learned from video, courses, books etc, i was able to write te code by myself,
course, i forgot some things and i was stuck in some parts and needed help to make it, but overall i think could handle the scene well.
I started to understand the importance of Git e GitHub in the coding world so i tried to learn that too. And i think it worked since here i'am...

**Overall, the things that i learned whas:
- Language mechanic usage;
- Language conceps usage;
- keyboard shortcuts;
- VS=Code extensions;
- code organization;
- Git e GitHub;
- Flex display;
- Class usage;

I really tried to use the basic here, but do something really nice wich i think i was able to. Overall, i used only HTML5, CSS and the Bootstrap framework wich i use Node.JS to dowload it.
