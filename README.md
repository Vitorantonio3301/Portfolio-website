## 1. Project description;
Hello, that's a project that i did for training purposes. I tried to create a portfolio-website using only HTML5 and CSS, using frameworks like Bootstrap with Node.JS.
So i tried to make some simple stuff like putting a photo, a simple text, two pages one beeing the "home" page and other the "about me' page. Really simple stuff.
I was really tryin to use all the most used concepts and mechanics in both languages, like divs, classes, separations and other things on HTML, but also hover, varients
flex display, positions, resposivity and more on CSS. Please notice,  this project was made with the help of a course that i'am doing wich was from where i took the design,
but all the code and things alike was writen by me wich i took little to nothing from the course. For those who speak portuguese and wanna know about the course, you can search
for Alura". I will also give them the credits more down on this document, but i decided to also mention here on the start.

## 2. project status;
üÜóüöß Ready/oingoin-project
I still trying to figure out things like resposivity for smaller devices like smartphones those that i know are one of the most importants ways the people acess internet nowadays.
My struggle with flex display continues, but  i can say that i'am way more confident and can play more then when i started with flex display. Course, i still trying to master it.
Overall, the project is ready, but i'll certainly evolve some things as i dive deeply into the programming world.

## 3. Funcionalities;
Some of the funcionalities that you can expect to find in this website are:
- Language mechanic usage;
- Language conceps usage;
- Muliple pages;
- Respostivity;
- Flex display;
- Organization;
- Hover;

Those are the funcionalities that i notice the most in the websites that i use this days. Seeing that, i tried to also implement those on my website.

## 4. Acquired knowledge;</h2>
For the most part i was focusing on the concept of flex display and the stuff surrounding it. So i learned a lot about it. 
Since i also writen all the code from the beginning using things that i learned from video, courses, books etc, i was able to write te code by myself,
course, i forgot some things and i was stuck in some parts and needed help to make it, but overall i think could handle the scene well.
I started to understand the importance of Git e GitHub in the coding world so i tried to learn that too. And i think it worked since i'am here...

**Overall, the things that i learned whas:
- Language mechanic usage;
- Language concepts usage;
- keyboard shortcuts;
- VS=Code extensions;
- code organization;
- Git e GitHub;
- Flex display;
- Class usage;

I really tried to use the basic here, but do something really nice wich i think i was able to. Overall, i used only HTML5, CSS and the Bootstrap framework wich i use Node.JS to dowload it.

## 8.Conclusion;
Well, that project was interesting... I had a lot of problems with it, but the most important was that in the end i was able to get over it and build something cool, not perfect, but cool.
I learned a lot from it and also realize things that i still need to learn asap. I still got to figure out how to proper use the flex display in CSS and his younger cooler brother SASS,
and also how to properly separate things in HTML to make things easier. Yeah, it itsn't perfect, but at least is something.
